#### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:

##### Step 1: Select the Distribution
In the simulation step, choose the type of distribution you want to explore. It can be either discrete or continuous.

##### Step 2: Set Parameters
Set all the parameters according to the selected distribution. For example, for Poisson distribution, set lambda > 0.

##### Step 3: Define the Event
Specify the event or outcome whose probability you want to evaluate within the selected distribution.

##### Step 4: Choose Graph Type
Select between "theoretical" and "randomized" for the graph type:
- "Theoretical" generates a graph based on the mathematical formula of the chosen distribution.
- "Randomized" generates a graph based on random data sampled from the selected distribution.

##### Step 5: Execute the Experiment
Click the 'Go' button to start the experiment. This triggers the generation of the distribution plot based on your selections.

##### Step 6: View the Graphical Representation
Observe the graphical representation of the selected distribution, which illustrates the probabilities associated with different outcomes or events.
