### Some of the standard distributions are:
## Normal Distribution Formula
For a random variable $\mathrm{x}$, with mean " $\mu$ " and standard deviation " $\sigma$ ", the probability density function for the normal distribution is given by:
Normal Distribution Formula:\
$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$
## Binomial distribution Formula 
 The binomial distribution formula is for any random variable $X$, given by;\
$P(x: n, p)={ }^n C_x p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$ Or $P(x: n, p)={ }^n C_x p^x(q)^{n-x}$\
where,\
- $n=$ the number of experiments
- $x=0,1,2,3,4, \ldots$
- $p=$ Probability of success in a single experiment
- $q=$ Probability of failure in a single experiment $(=1-p)$

## Poisson Distribution Formula
For a random discrete variable X that follows the Poisson distribution, and Î» is the average rate of value, then the probability of x is given by:\
$f(x)=P(X=x)=\left(e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x\right) / x !$
Where
- $x=0,1,2,3 \ldots$
- $e$ is the Euler's number $(e=2.718)$
- $\lambda$ is an average rate of the expected value and $\lambda=$ variance, also $\lambda>0$

For the distribution formula of geometric, uniform, exponential, gamma, erlang, beta, chi-squared, and student's t one can refer to book mentioned in refernces.
